# Data Structures Learning Repository

Welcome to my learning repository for Data Structures. The main goal of this project is to dive deep into the core concepts of data structures using C++, starting from basic concepts like arrays and gradually moving towards more complex structures like trees and graphs.

As part of the learning process, I will be writing comprehensive tests for each data structure I implement using Google Test. This will not only help solidify my understanding of these data structures but will also provide valuable practice in writing good tests.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `Arrays/`: Contains implementations and tests for array-related data structures.
- `LinkedLists/`: Contains implementations and tests for linked list data structures.
- `Stacks/`: Contains implementations and tests for stack data structures.
- `Queues/`: Contains implementations and tests for queue data structures.
- `Trees/`: Contains implementations and tests for tree data structures.
- `Graphs/`: Contains implementations and tests for graph data structures.

Each directory contains the implementation code, along with a corresponding `README.md` file that explains the data structure and its functionality. Additionally, a `Test/` directory within each data structure directory contains the test files for that particular data structure.

## Running the Tests

The tests are written using the Google Test framework. To run the tests, navigate to the respective data structure's `Test/` directory and use the command `make` to compile the tests, followed by `./runTests` to execute them.

Please note that you will need to have Google Test installed on your machine to run these tests. You can find installation instructions [here](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/README.md).

## Contributing

While this is primarily a personal learning project, I am open to any suggestions or improvements! Please feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request if you have any ideas.
