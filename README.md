# Data Structures with C++

This repository contains my study materials and exercises for understanding data structures in-depth using C++. 

## Introduction

In this repository, I will be sharing code snippets, notes, and exercise solutions as I progress through my deep dive into data structures. The primary language for this study is C++ due to its efficiency and the granular control it offers, which is crucial for understanding the underlying concepts of data structures.

## Contents

1. Arrays
2. Linked Lists
3. Stacks and Queues
4. Trees
5. Graphs
6. Hashing
7. Heaps
8. Advanced Topics

Each of these sections will be updated with notes and code snippets as I learn about them.

## Getting Started

To run these examples on your machine, you will need a C++ compiler. I am using [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/index.html), but any modern C++ compiler should work.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the directory containing the file you want to run
3. Compile the .cpp file using your C++ compiler
4. Run the resulting executable

## Contribution

While this repository is primarily for my personal use, I welcome suggestions and improvements. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request!
